## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to center elements using Flexbox and how to create a responsive card component.
I also learned the importance of:
- Using semantic tags like `<main>` for accessibility (WCAG).
- Using `max-width` instead of fixed width for responsiveness.
- Correct file paths for images on GitHub Pages.

### Continued development

My primary goal is to become a proficient **Full Stack Developer**. Once I establish a strong technical foundation in web development, I plan to expand my expertise into **Prompt Engineering**.

Additionally, I have a growing interest in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, which I intend to explore as complementary skills to my development career in the long term.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is the absolute best documentation for web development. It helped me understand semantic HTML tags and how to center elements using CSS Flexbox.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - I used this to import the 'Outfit' font family as required by the design style guide.
